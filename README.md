# 28.4 LAB: Scrabble points

---

Scrabble is a word game in which words are constructed from letter tiles, each letter tile containing a point value. The value of a word is the sum of each tile's points added to any points provided by the word's placement on the game board.
Write a program using the given dictionary of letters and point values that takes a word as input and outputs the base total value of the word (before being put onto a board).
